# Consistency Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the consistency fixes made to align the frontend API layer, backend models, and API endpoints.

  - Updated field names: `dp` → `tp`, `units` → `unit`
  - Removed `sku` field references

### 6. Updated Sales Types
- **Updated `features/sales/types.ts`:**
  - Removed `sku` field references
  - Updated field names: `units` → `unit`

### 7. Updated Sales Service

  - Imports Customer model for statistics tracking
  - Updates `totalOrders` and `totalSpent` for customers

### 8. Updated Stock Model
- **Updated `features/stock/model.ts`:**
  - Changed `quantity` → `unit` to match types and services
  - Updated interface and schema accordingly

### 9. Updated Stock Types
- **Updated `features/stock/types.ts`:**
  - Changed `quantity` → `unit` in all interfaces
  - Updated filter names: `minQuantity`/`maxQuantity` → `minUnit`/`maxUnit`
  - Updated stats interface: `totalQuantity` → `totalUnit`

### 10. Updated Stock Service
- **Updated `features/stock/service.ts`:**
  - Changed `quantity` → `unit` in all validation and creation logic
  - Updated error messages accordingly
  - Fixed both POST and PUT methods

### 11. Updated Demand Service
- **Updated `features/demand/service.ts`:**
  - Changed `quantity` → `unit` when converting demand to stock
  - Maintained `quantity` for demand items (correct for demand model)

### 12. Standardized API Response Structures
- **Updated all services to use consistent pagination format:**
  ```typescript
  {
    success: true,
    data: items,
    pagination: {
      page: number,
      limit: number,
      total: number,
      totalPages: number
    }
  }
  ```
- **Fixed services:**
  - `features/customers/service.ts`
  - `features/demand/service.ts`
  - `features/sales/service.ts` (already correct)
  - `features/products/service.ts` (already correct)
  - `features/users/service.ts` (already correct)
  - `features/stock/service.ts` (already correct)

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Models as Source of Truth:** All types and services now match their corresponding models exactly
2. **Consistent Field Names:** Used `unit` for stock quantities, `tp` for trade price
3. **Standardized Responses:** All API endpoints now return consistent pagination structure
4. **Removed Unnecessary Fields:** Eliminated stock arrays, upc, sku, warranty as requested
5. **Sales-Focused:** Removed all order-related functionality, keeping only sales

## Files Modified
